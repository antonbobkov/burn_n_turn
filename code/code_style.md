- class style guide
  - class name is CamelCase
  - function names are CamelCase
  - variables names are snake_case
  - public first, private last
  - comment above each non-trivial/non-obvious member function and member variable
  - member variables end with an underscore
  - none of the other function arguments end in underscore
  - no public variables, everything should be controlled via public member functions. Use getters and setters if needed.
  - if non-template, functions > 1 line should be implemented in cpp file
