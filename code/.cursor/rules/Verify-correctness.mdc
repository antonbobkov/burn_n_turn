After modifying CMake files, run cmake and build. After modifying code, make sure project builds and all tests pass. Even if the build/test issues are unrelated to modified code, fix them anyway. Most important test is simulator_test, always make sure it passes.

After finishing requested changes, generate short summary string which can be used as a commit description.

Assume the workspace is the source directory (code). Build and bin are its
siblings. From the workspace root:

To make and build: `cd ../build; cmake ../code -G "MinGW Makefiles";
mingw32-make`

To build only: `cd ../build; mingw32-make`

To run all tests: `cd ../build; ctest --output-on-failure`. Don't run tests
if build didn't succeed.

To run simulation test: `cd ../bin; .\simulation_test.exe`

Important: run cmake only from inside the build directory.
