After modifying CMake files, run cmake and build. After modifying code, make sure project builds and all tests pass. Even if the build/test issues are unrelated to modified code, fix them anyway. Most important test is simulator_test, always make sure it passes.

After finishing requested changes, generate short summary string which can be used as a commit description.

To make and build, run `cd c:\coding\dragongame_git\build; cmake ../code -G "MinGW Makefiles"; mingw32-make`

To build, run `cd c:\coding\dragongame_git\build; mingw32-make`

To run all tests, run `cd c:\coding\dragongame_git\build; ctest --output-on-failure`. Don't run tests if build didn't succeed.

To run simluation test, run `cd c:\coding\dragongame_git\bin; .\simulation_test.exe`

Important: don't run cmake command outside of this build directory.
