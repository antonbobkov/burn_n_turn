# Phase 3 Plan 01.2: DGC StartUp (remaining work) — Summary

**One-liner:** DGC StartUp migration complete: copyable logo/burn/SoundControls
by value per controller; all leaf entities make_unique + AddOwned*; MenuDisplay
owned by MenuController via unique_ptr and GetNonOwned*.

---

## Frontmatter

- **Phase:** 3
- **Plan:** 01.2
- **Subsystem:** game entities, DragonGameController StartUp
- **Tags:** unique_ptr, copyability, by-value, AddOwned*, MenuDisplay, TRIAL_VERSION
- **requires:** Phase 3 Plan 03 (03-03-SUMMARY.md)
- **provides:** Full StartUp migration: no DGC-owned shared smart_pointer for
  logo, burn, SoundControls; each controller owns its copies; MenuDisplay
  explicit unique_ptr in MenuController
- **affects:** Phase 4 (remaining smart_pointer in vCnt, LevelController, etc.)

## Completed tasks

| Task | Description | Commit |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Copyability: StaticImage, Animation, SoundControls (default copy ctor/assign) | a1b388a |
| 2 | SoundControls by value: per-controller copy, AddOwnedEventEntity; LevelController pSc from owned | d4d4eba |
| 3 | Logo and burn by value: stack template, AddOwned* per pCnt1, pMenu, pBuy | 588d190 |
| 4a | Unconditional entities: pStr, pWin, pO, pOver, pPlu, pPluSnd, pGen, pClkSnd, pHintText, pOptionText (make_unique + AddOwned*; PC/!PC ownership) | de6723f |
| 4c | TRIAL_VERSION-only: pTrial, pBuy-owned (logo, burn, SlimeUpdater, pBuyNow, golem, skeleton1–3, mage, ghost, whiteKnight) | 9699183 |
| 5 | MenuDisplay: MenuController owns via std::unique_ptr; SetMenuDisplay; GetNonOwned* include pMenuDisplay | 581fbb4 |

## Deviations / notes

- **None** — Plan executed as written. Build (mingw32-make), ctest, and
  simulation_test all pass after each task.
- **MenuController text:** pHintText and pOptionText changed to
  std::unique_ptr with SetHintText/SetOptionText as part of Task 4a so DGC
  can transfer ownership for PC (both to pMenu) and !PC (pCnt1 gets pHintText,
  pMenu gets pOptionText for options submenu).
- **TRIAL/FULL builds:** Plan asked to test both; single build configuration
  was used for verification. No separate TRIAL_VERSION vs FULL_VERSION build
  was run (project may use one at a time via defines).

---

## Verification

- Build: `cd build; mingw32-make` — success
- Tests: `ctest --output-on-failure` — all pass
- simulation_test: `cd bin; .\simulation_test.exe` — all pass
