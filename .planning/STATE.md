# Project State

**Project:** Smart Pointer Migration  
**See:** .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2025-02-16)

**Core value:** The migration must preserve behavior: the project must keep
building and all tests (especially simulation_test) must pass after every
change.

**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Process and leaf (game_utils)

**Completed:** None. Roadmap and requirements defined; ready to execute
Phase 1.

**Next:** Run `/gsd-discuss-phase 1` to gather context and clarify approach,
or `/gsd-plan-phase 1` to plan Phase 1 directly.
