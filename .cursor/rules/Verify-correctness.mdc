After modifying CMake files, run cmake and build. After modifying code, make sure project builds and all tests pass. Even if the build/test issues are unrelated to modified code, fix them anyway. Most important test is simulator_test, always make sure it passes.

Assume the workspace is the source directory (code). Build and bin are its
siblings. From the workspace root:

To make and build: `cd build; cmake ../code -G "MinGW Makefiles"; mingw32-make`

To build only: `cd build; mingw32-make`

To run all tests: `cd build; ctest --output-on-failure`. Don't run tests
if build didn't succeed.

To run simulation test: `cd bin; .\simulation_test.exe`

Important: run cmake only from inside the build directory.

Don't use && or || in shell commands. You're in Powershell, it needs semicolons instead
