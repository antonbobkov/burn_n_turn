When making a plan, incorporate following instructions into implementation steps:
- First create an implementation summary .md doc. Name it the same as plan name but with _implementation_summary postfix
- For each step document:
  - how implementation end up deviating from the plan and why
  - what issues you ran into, if any
  - how you solved those issues
  - any general tips for the future how to avoid these issues, if any
- After finising implementation, add a summary section on top of implementation summary. Summarize points from each of the steps: deviations, issues, solutions, and - most importantly - tips for the future.

Specifically
- Add creating summary document as the first implementation step. 
- At end of each step remind to update summary document
- Last implementation step should be to finalize summary document
